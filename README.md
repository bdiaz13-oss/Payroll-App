This Flask-based web application serves as a personal tool for managing payroll records and tracking digital expenses or hours worked. As a user, I can add, edit, view, and delete employee details like names and pay rates, along with pay records including hours logged, overtime, deductions, automated gross/net pay calculations, and notes. It offers features like a dashboard with paginated cards, date-based filtering, search by name or period, and CSV export for easy reporting, all stored in a JSON file without needing a database, with a responsive Bootstrap interface for seamless use on any device.

I developed this app with assistance from Generative AI (Grok by xAI), which generated the initial code structure, forms, routes, and logic based on my prompts. The AI also helped debug errors (e.g., JSON decoding, ValueError in exports), refine features like pay formatting to two decimals and form clarifications (e.g., no $ signs in inputs), and incorporate updates such as overtime handling and CSV exports, creating a functional, deployable project.
